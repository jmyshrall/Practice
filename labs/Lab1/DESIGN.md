- Installing pygame
  1) While it was not completely new I did a pip installation on pycharm whereas before I had done it
on an Arduino, it was easier than I expected requiring a simple command using the pycharm terminal

  2) A roadblock I did encounter was using the `import` function on the installed pygame library as it gave me an error
stating it could not import the library due to the installation not working. So I checked the installation in the 
terminal using the `pip list` command, I saw the installation, so I was confused on the issue still. I 
finally checked pycharm's help bar which suggested a fix that worked instantly resolving the issue.

  3) I am interested in learning more about pip installs and how different installations can allow you to code 
any number of programs, as my only other experience with pip libraries was in a project involving different hardware
that utilized a variety of new commands from a pip library. 

- Starting the game project
  1) The part of this section that was new to me was interacting with aspects of the pygame library to change
aspects of the game I was creating, as I had never used the library before.

  2) A roadblock I experienced was trying to understand how the `class` function works as I have little experience 
with it. I understood it better by tracing the code in the textbook and noticing how the classes are used to easily call
functions within functions, like using `from ship import Ship` to easily access the functions in the `Ship` class.

  3) I want to be more proficient at using classes when I program as I see how useful they can be when designing
a compact and neat program.

- Adding the Ship Image
  1) The concept that was new to me when adding the ship image was using certain commands to establish the position
of an image such as `self.rect.bottom = self.screen_rect.bottom` as I had never worked with images in python in this
capacity before.

  2) A roadblock I found was in getting the ship image as the book had a link to the image, but it required buying the 
textbook. So I looked at my other options before asking for help, I instead looked at the GitHub repository of the 
completed project and found the image there. 

  3) An aspect of python I want to explore more would be working with pulling from files and manipulating their contents
using a variety of functions similar to pulling the ship image and changing its size/position. 

- Conclusion
  1) The project took around 3 hours which was spaced out across two days, one for implementation one for the design. 
I found this worked better to avoid burnout and allowed me to complete the assignment efficiently

  2) This project was fairly simple and there was no collaboration involved as it wasn't needed. 

  3) I learned there is a lot about python I do not have a full understanding of such as classes, pulling from files, 
and pip installations. I am very interested in these topics however and am excited to delve further into them as well
as new topics as the semester progresses.
