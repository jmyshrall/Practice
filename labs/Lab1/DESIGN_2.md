- Piloting the ship

  1) In this section a concept that I had never used before was using the keyboard to interact with a program
while it was running. In this section I used functions such as `event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:` to move the ship
image left and right on the game screen. This was very interesting to see as I learned how pip installs can
add totally new functionality to how we run programs.
  
  2) One major roadblock I hit was dividing the `check_events` function into two new functions as the textbook was 
hard to follow. I kept running into red system errors in the dozens due to how I was trying to separate the functions.
The solution to the problem I had was within the GitHub repository of the completed project, where I saw what lines
went other what functions as well as the proper indices to make it work properly. 

  3) From this section I am honestly interested in how to make larger programs appear neat, in this section
I spent a decent amount of time operating code based on what each line is for and which ones go together. As this
game develops I want to see how I could continue to make all this code legible to someone trying to trace it. 

- Shooting Bullets

  1) In this section I experimented with the bullet deletion line of code `bullets.remove(bullet)` which is new to me.
I used this line to remove redundant bullets that were off the screen in order to save on processing power for the game
as you only want to run enough to make the game work. The idea of making something as efficient as possible isn't new \
but doing it like this in programming is, and it is very interesting

  2) One roadblock I hit was the bullets firing in the console, but I could not see anything despite having no errors in
my code according to Pycharm. After rereading the textbook I realized several lines of code from certain sections were 
either redundant or missing. So I reviewed my code and made some revisions which lead to the bullets being properly 
displayed on the screen. 

  3) I am interested in learning about how to make programs run more efficiently by removing aspects of the program
that are not strictly needed. As I feel this concept will be extremely important as I continue to develop my skills
in programming by making more complex programs for more complex problems. 

- Conclusion

  1) The project took about 2 hours and I did it within one sitting. I feel that was not the best approach as I got 
burnt out and frustrated easily when faced with simple issues that did not have very hard solutions. I feel I would 
have benefited from spacing the project out more. 

  2) No collaboration was used for this assignment. 

  3) I learned that I would benefit to a slower approach to programming as opposed to crunching it in one day. 
As I am prone to being frustrated and burnt out more easily when trying to finish something in a small-time slot.
Moving forward I think it would be better to space out my assignments more.
