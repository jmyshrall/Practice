> COMP 424 Applied Computing: **Project 5**

### Purpose
- Learn and practice with Python class concepts: 
  - constructor, class and instance variables, instance methods
- Gain more practice multiple Python modules and separating the development 
  of a class in`genpass.py` and how the class is used in `main.py`.
- Use test-driven incremental development to document, test, design, 
    implement, and debug functions

### Examine the starter project
- Read the guidelines in this document. 
- Read the content of the  `genpass.py` module. What does it contain? 
- Read the content of the `main.py` module. What does it contain?
- Check code analysis and style warning and errors
- Run `pylint` and `pycodestyle` code analysis tools.
  - What errors do you get?
- Run each module. 
  - What errors do you get? Why?
- Discuss and clarify what the implementation does.

### Document both modules
- Write your name as the program's developer
- Write the name of your collaborator(s)
- Write the date when you got started

### Develop the instance methods of class `GeneratePassword`
To completely develop each method, use the test-driven incremental 
development approach:
1. Understand and write the code in `main()` that calls the method
2. Write the design of the method in `DESIGN.md`.
3. Implement the method in `genpass.py`.

### Self-Evaluation
- Documentation: 10%
  - %5 for each module docstring
- Testing: 20%, 5% for each method
- Design: 40%, 8% for each function
- Implementation: 20, 5% for each method
- Code analysis and styling: 10%

### Submission
- Go to https://github.com/orgs/2023-spring-comp-424 to find your 
  **project5-xxx** remote repo in GitHub.
- Use the `Add File --> Upload` and choose your local files for uploading:
  - `genpass.py`
  - `main.py`
  - `DESIGN.md`
- Upload ONLY the files, do NOT upload the entire `practice_classes` directory.
