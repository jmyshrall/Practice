> COMP 424 Applied Computing: **Homework 3**

### Purpose
- Gain more practice with reading text files and processing data from file.
- Gain more practice with multiple Python modules and separating the 
  - development of functions in `analysis.py` and
  - demonstration of the functions in `main.py`
- Use test-driven incremental development to document, test, design, 
    implement, and debug functions

### Examine the starter project
- Read the guidelines in this document. 
- Read the content of the  `analysis.py` module. What does it contain? 
- Read the content of the `main.py` module. What does it contain?
- Check code analysis and style warning and errors
  - Fix them, if you find fixable errors at this examination step.
- Run `pylint` and `pycodestyle` code analysis tools.
  - What errors do you get? Are the errors fixable?
- Run each module. 
  - What errors do you get? Why?
- Discuss and clarify what the implementation does.

### Document both modules
- Write your name as the program's developer
- Write the date when you got started

### Develop the functions in `analysis.py`
To completely develop each function, use the test-driven incremental 
development approach:
1. Understand and write the code in `main()` that calls the function with 3 
   different test cases, for each of the CSV files
2. Write the design of the function in `DESIGN.md`.
3. Implement the function in `analysis.py`.

### Evaluation
- Documentation: 8%
  - %4 for each module docstring
- Demonstration: 27%
  - There are 3 test cases. Each test case demo all 3 functions
  - Total of 9 mini-demos, 3% each mini-demo
- Design: 30%, 10% for each function
- Implementation: 15%, 5% for each function
- Code analysis and styling: 10%
- Reflection: 10% Complete the post-homework questionnaire at

### Submission
- Go to https://github.com/orgs/2023-spring-comp-424 to find your 
  **homework3-xxx** remote repo in GitHub.
- Use the `Add File --> Upload` and choose your local files for uploading:
  - `analysis.py`
  - `main.py`
  - `DESIGN.md`
  - All three CSV files
- Upload ONLY the files, do NOT upload the entire `practice_classes` directory.
