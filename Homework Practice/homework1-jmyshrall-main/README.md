> COMP 424 Applied Computing: **Homework 1, Week 4**

### Purpose
- Solve Parsons Problems and computational problems to learn how to:
  - document, test, design, implement, and debug functions.
- Learn the concepts of:
  - statement, function definition and function call
  - iteration with `for ...  in ... 
  - sequence data type: `str` and `list`
- Apply these concepts to solve computational problems. 

### Guidelines
- Read the code in `functions.py` module. It contains **function stubs**: 
  function headers along wiht function docstrings describing WHAT the 
  function should do. 
- Each function implements an exercise in the textbook. Chapter, section, 
  and exercise number information is provided. 
----
For EACH of the first two functions, do the following:
- Solve the Parsons problem in the textbook first. 
- When you find the solution, type in the statements in the right order in 
  the `functions.py`
- Call the function in `main()`
- In the **PyCharm Terminal**
  - Run, debug, and fix errors if you get errors. 
  - Open PyCharms Problems tab on the bottom menu bar to check that there 
    are no errors. 
---
For the third function, `count_odd()`:
  - **PART 1**: 
    - In the `funcdtions.py` file, in`main()`:
      - Call the function with the THREE examples given in the docstring 
    - In the **PyCharm Terminal**:
      - Run, debug, and fix errors if you get errors. Don't forget the 
        check the PyCharm Problems window. 
  - **PART 2**: In the `DESIGN.md` file:
    - Outline the problem-solving steps
    - Based on the outline, write the computational steps. 
  - **PART 3**: 
    - In the `functions.py` file
      - Write the implementation based on the design
    - In the **PyCharm Terminal**
      - Run. debug, and fix errors if any. Don't forget the 
        check the PyCharm Problems window. 

### Evaluation
- Testing: 24%, 3 tests
- Design: 20%
- Implementation: 36%
  - 16% for the Parsons problem, 8% each
  - 20% for `count_odd()`
- Code styling: 20%
