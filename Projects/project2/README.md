> COMP 424 Applied Computing: **Project 1, Week 4**

### Purpose
- Learn the concepts of
  - statement, function definition, iteration with `for ... in ...`, and 
    sequence data type
- Apply these concepts to solve computational problems. 

### Guidelines
- Read the code in `functions.py` module. It contains **function stubs**: 
  function headers along wiht function docstrings describing WHAT the 
  function should do. 
- Each function implements an exercise in the textbook. Chapter, section, 
  and exercise number information is provided. 
----
For EACH of the first three functions, do the following:
- Solve the Parsons problem in the textbook first. 
- When you find the solution, in the corresponding function in 
  `functions.py` file, type in the statements in the right order.
- Call the function in `main()`
- In the **PyCharm Terminsl**
  - Run and debug and fix errors if you get errors.
---
For the fourth function
  - **PART 1**: 
    - In the `funcdtions.py` file, in`main()`:
      - Call the function with the examples given in the docstring 
    - In the **PyCharm Terminal**:
      - Run and debug and fix errors if you get errors.
  - **PART 2**: In the `DESIGN.md` file:
    - Outline the problem solving steps
    - Based on the outline, write the computational steps. 
  - **PART 3**: 
    - In the `functions.py` file
      - Write the implementation based on the design
    - In the **PyCharm Terminal**
      - Run and debug and fix errors if any. 

### Evaluation
- Testing: 20%
- Design: 20%
- Implementation: 40%
- Code styling: 20%

### Submisesion
Upload the following files to the **remote repository project2-xxx**, where 
**xxx** is your GitHub user name. 
- Go to https://github.com/orgs/2023-spring-comp-424 to find your 
  **project2-xxx** remote repo in GitHub.
- Use the `Add File --> Upload` and choose your local **project2** files: 
  `functions.py` and `DESIGN.md` for uploading.
