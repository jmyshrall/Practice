> COMP 424 Applied Computing: **Project 4**

### Purpose
- Learn and practice with dictionary
- Learn the histogram pattern: a special case of accumulation pattern
- Use test-driven incremental development to document, test, design, 
    implement, and debug functions

### Examine the starter project
- Read the code in `histograms_and_dictionaries.py` module. 
- The code has **function stubs** that include:
  - function headers and 
  - function docstrings that describe WHAT the function should do. 
- Read the guidelines in this document. 

#### Document `histograms_and_dictionaries.py` module
- Write your name as the program's developer
- Write the name of your collaborator(s)
- Write the date when you got started

### Develop the functions
To completely develop each function, use the test-driven incremental 
development approach:
- Understand and test the function
- Write the design
- Implement the function

#### Understand and test the function
In the `main()` function definition, write TWO tests. To write each test:
- Define local variables and assign them concrete values that match the 
  function parameters
- Call the function with arguments that represent the variable you just 
  defined. 
- Assign the return value from the call to a `result` variable. Print 
  `result` variable.
- The fist test is identical to the test provided in the docstring. 
- The second test must be different. 

In the **PyCharm Terminal**:
- Change directory with the `cd` bash command to be in the `project4` 
  directory 
- Run the program with the command `python histograms_and_dictionaries.py`
- If there are debugging errors, find them and fix them.

In the **Problems** tab on the status menu bar:
- Check if there are code analysis and styling errors. 
- If there are, find them and fix them. 

#### Design the function
In the `DESIGN.md` file:
  - Outline the problem-solving steps
  - Use the outline to further describe the problem solving steps in terms 
    of computations.

#### Implement the function
In the `histograms_and_dictionaries.py` file
- Write the implementation based on the design

In the **PyCharm Terminal**:
- Check that the current directory is `projectc4` with the bash command `pwd`
- Run the program with the command `histograms_and_dictionaries.py`
- If there are debugging errors, find them and fix them.

In the **Problems** tab:
- Check if there are code analysis and styling errors. 
- If there are, find them and fix them. 

### Evaluation
- Documentation: 4%
  - Module docstring has developer name, collaborator(s) name, and date 
    information
- Testing: 24%, 8 tests, 2 tests per function, 3% each test
- Design: 32%, 10% each function
- Implementation: 24%, 6% each function
- Code analysis and styling: 10%
- Reflection: 6%. Complete the post-project questionnaire at [https://forms.gle/PZwYfLCEGHAGdNNE6](https://forms.gle/PZwYfLCEGHAGdNNE6)

### Submission
- Go to https://github.com/orgs/2023-spring-comp-424 to find your 
  **project4-xxx** remote repo in GitHub.
- Use the `Add File --> Upload` and choose your local files: 
  `histograms_and_dictionaries.py` and `DESIGN.md` for uploading.
- Upload ONLY the files, do NOT upload the entire `project4` directory.
