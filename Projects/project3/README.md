> COMP 424 Applied Computing: **Project 3, Week 5**

### Purpose
- Practice more with the concepts of
  - statement, function definition, function call, and iteration with `for ... 
    in ...`, and 
    sequence data type
- Learn about randomness and the Python `random` methods to use randomness 
  in solving problems.

### Guidelines
- Read the code in `functions.py` module. It contains **function stubs**: 
    - function headers along wiht 
    - function docstrings 
  
  to describe WHAT the function should do. 
- There are 3 functions that generate a passowrd using different approaches.

---
For each function

  - **PART 1**: 
    - Write TWO tests cases the `main()` funciton. For each test case:
      - Define a variable to reference the value returned from the function call.
      - Call the function with arguments that match the parameters 
        descriptions in the function docstring 
      - Print out the variable.
    - In the **PyCharm Terminal**:
      - Run, debug and fix errors if you get errors.
      - Check PyCharm Problems warnings and errors and fix them.
      
  - **PART 2**: In the `DESIGN.md` file:
    - Outline the problem solving steps
    - Based on the outline, write the computational steps. 
    
  - **PART 3**: 
    - In the `functions.py` file
      - Write the implementation based on the design
    - In the **PyCharm Terminal**
      - Run, debug, and fix errors if any. 
      - Check PyCharm Problems warnings and errors and fix them.
      
### Evaluation
- Documentation: 10%
  - Properly written module docstring
- Testing: 24%
  - There are 2 tests per function, toatl of 6, 4% each
- Design: 25%: 5% 1st problem, 10% each of the remaining problems
- Implementation: 25%, 5% 1st problem, 10% each of the remaining problems
- Code analysis and stye: 16%

### Submission
Upload the `DESIGN.md` and `functions.py` files to the **remote repository 
project3-xxx**, where **xxx** is your GitHub user name. 

- Go to https://github.com/orgs/2023-spring-comp-424 to find your 
  **project3-xxx** remote repo in GitHub.
- Use the `Add File --> Upload` and choose your local **project3** files: 
  `functions.py` and `DESIGN.md` for uploading.
